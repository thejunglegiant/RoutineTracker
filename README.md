# RoutineTracker
A light app which will help you with tracking all your tasks and maybe the hole routine in the near future! I'm making this project just for fun, a bit practise and as a university project for the first semester.
Technologies that are used:
- Kotlin, as a main language;
- Room for storing all the data in internal storage.
