# RoutineTracker
A light app which will help you with tracking all your tasks and maybe the whole routine in the future! I made this project just for fun, a bit practise and as a university project for the first semester.
# Technologies
* Kotlin, as a main language;
* Android Architecture Components
* Jetpack library
# Deploying
* Clone the repo
* Run your Android emulator (minSdkVersion: 26)
* Install the app, simply `./gradlew installDebug` should work
