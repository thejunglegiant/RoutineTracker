# RoutineTracker
A light app which will help you with tracking all your tasks and maybe the whole routine in the near future! I made this project just for fun, a bit practise and as a university project for the first semester.
Technologies that are used:
- kotlin, as a main language;
- room for storing all the data in internal storage.
